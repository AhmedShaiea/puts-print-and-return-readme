# Print, Puts, and Return

## Puts and Print

The puts (short for "put string") and print commands are both used to display the results of evaluating Ruby code. The primary difference between them is that `puts` adds a newline after executing, and `print` does not.

```ruby
3.times { print "Hello!" }
# => Hello!Hello!Hello!

3.times { puts "Hello!" }
# => Hello!
# => Hello!
# => Hello!
```

## Return
